The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory details the estimated New York State emissions releases from fuel combustion.  The dataset includes emissions for each year from 1990 through the present (currently 2010), broken down by the sector (Residential/Commercial/Industrial, Electricity generation, and Transportation).  The dataset also includes a fuel type breakdown, also by sector, for the current year.

How does your organization use this dataset? What other NYSERDA or energy-related datasets would you like to see on Open NY? Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.
