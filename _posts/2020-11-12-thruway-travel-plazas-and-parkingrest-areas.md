The Travel Plazas and Parking/Rest Areas is an informational aid for travelers along the Thruway System that provides patrons with a listing of travel plazas and parking/rest areas and their locations. The csv file contains the latitude and longitude, milepost, direction of the location of the travel plaza and parking/rest area and the route name along which they are located.
