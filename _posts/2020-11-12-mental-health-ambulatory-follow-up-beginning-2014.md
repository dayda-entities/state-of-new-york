New York State is moving Medicaid behavioral health services from a fee-for-service system into Managed Care.
OMH Medicaid Behavioral Health Measures were developed to help monitor the transition of mental health services from a fee-for-service to behavioral managed care. 

The MH Ambulatory Follow-up dataset displays percentages of Medicaid discharges for members 6-64 years of age who were hospitalized in an inpatient setting with a primary diagnosis of mental illness that were followed by an outpatient visit, an intensive outpatient encounter or partial hospitalization for mental health treatment within 7 and 30 days of discharge.
