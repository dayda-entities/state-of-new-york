New York State is moving Medicaid behavioral health services from a fee-for-service system into Managed Care.
OMH/OASAS Medicaid Behavioral Health Measures were developed to help monitor the transition of mental health and substance use disorder services from a fee-for-service to behavioral managed care. 

The MH Continuity of Medication dataset displays percentages of Medicaid discharges for members 6-64 years of age who were hospitalized in an inpatient setting with a primary diagnosis of mental illness that a prescription for a psychotropic medication was filled within 30 days of discharge.
