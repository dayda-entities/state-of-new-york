The Pilot Pharmaceutical Take-Back Program covers the costs of consumer drug collection boxes and disposal for two years, and gives pharmacies a safe, convenient, and effective way to keep drugs out of our waters and out of the wrong hands.
Addresses of participating pharmacies, hospitals, and long-term care facilities participating in the New York State Department of Environmental Conservationâ€™s Pilot Pharmaceutical Take-Back Program with medication collection boxes. Medication collection boxes only collect solid state controlled and non-controlled substances. Medication collection boxes do not accept sharps, liquids, personal care products, etc.
