The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey quarterly produces a data file and provides information on monthly in-bound, out-bound, and connecting Coach Bus passengers between John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport; and between aforementioned airports and NYC bus stations beginning in 2002. The dataset represents aggregate numbers of single destination (e.g. A -> B) Coach Bus ticket sale by the Coach Bus companies.
