The Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS) Program encourages cost-effective electric and natural gas energy efficiency across New York State.  New York Stateâ€™s utilities and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) administer energy efficiency programs to achieve energy efficiency savings. EEPS energy efficiency programs provide technical services, information and customer incentives to encourage customers in implementing energy efficiency measures.  This data includes the list of energy efficiency programs and the estimated energy savings reported for each program.
