The Port Authority collects eastbound vehicle traffic volumes from its toll plazas at the six Port Authority vehicular crossings (i.e., George Washington Bridge, Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, Goethals Bridge, Outerbridge Crossing and Bayonne Bridge).  This dataset contains annual eastbound traffic volumes for each crossing and for all Port Authority crossings combined, based on vehicles passing through Authorityâ€™s toll plazas, for each year from 2002 through 2012.  The dataset contains traffic volumes for three types of vehicles (autos, buses, trucks) for each year.
