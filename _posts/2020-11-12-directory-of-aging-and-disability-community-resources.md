This data set from NYS Office for the Aging (OFA) provides a listing of community resources to help the public find services for older and disabled New Yorkers.  Included is information on:  AAAs (Area Agencies on Aging), local offices that plan, develop and support comprehensive in-home and community services; HIICAPs (Health Insurance Information Counseling Program) that provide free, accurate and objective information, counseling, assistance and advocacy on Medicare, private health insurance, and related health coverage plans; LTCOP (Long Term Care Ombudsman Program) office resources and advocates for older adults and persons with disabilities who live in nursing homes, assisted living and other licensed adult care homes; and NYConnects, trusted places for information and assistance about long term services and supports whether you are paying for services yourself, through insurance, or eligible for a government program.
