Energy storage is critical to New York’s clean energy future. As renewable power sources like wind and solar provide a larger portion of New York’s electricity, storage will allow clean energy to be available when and where it is most needed. NYSERDA’s retail and bulk storage incentive programs are directed at achieving New York’s 3,000 MW by 2030 energy storage goal and 1,500 MW by 2025 energy storage target, codified in the Climate Leadership and Community Preservation Act. In December 2018, the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) issued a landmark energy storage order establishing the 3,000 MW by 2030 goal and authorizing the incentive programs. Details on the incentive structure and design are available at https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/energystorage.

Retail and Bulk Energy Storage Incentive Programs Reported by NYSERDA: Beginning 2019 dataset includes data points for projects completed and approved in the pipeline (not yet installed) in NYSERDA’s Incentive Programs beginning April 2019. 

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and support to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
