This data set shows the location of center line rumble strips installed across state highways in New York State by the Department of Transportation (NYS DOT).  It  includes the county and route where installed, the to and from reference markers definining the installation, the length in miles and the year each section was completed. Centerline Rumble Strips are installed to reduce fatal and injury accident resulting from "Run off the Road Crashes" (non-intersection head-on and opposite-direction sideswipe crashes). The official name for centerline rumble strips is Centerline Audible Roadway Delineators (CARDS).
