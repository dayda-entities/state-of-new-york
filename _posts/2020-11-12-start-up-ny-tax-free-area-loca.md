Empire State Development (ESD) produces an annual report with a cumulative list of College and University Sponsors approved in the START-UP NY Program.  The dataset displays the name of the Sponsor, the street address, city and county of the tax-free areas (TFA) designated by that college or university, square footage of each building space and acreage of each parcel of vacant land, the name of buildings designated and the START-UPNY website of the college.
