The Port Authority of NY & NJ annually reports on motor vehicle crashes throughout its facilities.  The data reported in this dataset represents motor vehicle crashes of vehicles in transport on public trafficways within Port Authority jurisdiction.  A crash is a harmful event which involves a motor vehicle in transport that strikes another motor vehicle, other property, debris, animal, pedestrian, or bicyclist, or in which a motor vehicle overturns (rolls over), jackknifes, catches fire or explodes while within the trafficway.
