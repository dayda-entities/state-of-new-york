The Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), New York's largest student financial aid grant program, helps eligible New York residents attending in-state postsecondary institutions pay for tuition. TAP grants are based on the applicant’s and his or her family’s New York State taxable income.  This data includes TAP award recipients and dollar amounts by college, sector groups, and Level of Study for academic years 2000-2011.
