Highway Work Permits are issued by the New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) for any work conducted in the NY State highway right of way.  The review and approval of proposed work in the right of way is important to keep the complex and heavily used transportation system operating efficiently, reliably and safely.  The Highway Work Permits dataset is a listing of all work permits issued on an annual basis.  Highway Work Permits ensure that any work done within the State right of way and the resulting finished project meets the standards and policies of public safety, highway laws and regulations, preservation and function of the highway, and that the work is in the best interests of the traveling public as well as the owner of the project. This dataset includes information on the term of the permits, type of work, applicant name and location of the work.
