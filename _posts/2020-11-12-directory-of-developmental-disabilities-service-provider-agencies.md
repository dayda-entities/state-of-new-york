This data set contains the address and phone number information for voluntary provider agencies of the following Office for People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD) supports and services:  Intermediate Care Facilities (ICFs), Individual Residential Alternative (IRAs), Family Care, Self-Direction Services, Individual Support Services (ISSs), Day Training, Day Treatment, Senior/Geriatric Services, Day Habilitation, Work Shop, Prevocational, Supported Employment Enrollments, Community Habilitation, Family Support Services, Care At Home Waiver Services, and Developmental Centers And Special Population Services.  The State sector district offices (DDSOs) have remained in the Developmental Disabilities Service Provider Agencies data because they too are identified by a provider agency code that identifies the voluntary providers.
