The Department of Taxation and Finance annually produces a data file providing property tax rates and levies for the taxing jurisdictions in New York State.  The data are culled from files on the State Comptrollerâ€™s website.  The dataset takes each school district segment and provides the levy for county, municipal and school tax purposes, as well as the tax rates that apply in those taxing jurisdictions.
