Gasoline retail prices weekly average by region dataset provides the weekly average retail gasoline prices for New York State and sixteen New York metropolitan regions in U.S. dollars per gallon.  Data is a weekly average from October 2007 through current.  Some metropolitan regions begin in 2017.   

Average daily retail gasoline prices are collected from the American Automobile Association (AAA) Daily Fuel Gauge Report.  The AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report prices are averaged to produce a weekly average retail price for New York State and each metropolitan region.

The New York State metropolitan regions in the dataset are Albany (Albany-Schenectady-Troy), Batavia, Binghamton, Buffalo (Buffalo-Niagara Falls), Dutchess (Dutchess-Putnam), Elmira, Glens Falls, Ithaca, Kingston, Nassau (Nassau-Suffolk), New York City, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica (Utica-Rome), Watertown (Watertown-Fort Drum), and White Plains.

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and support to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
