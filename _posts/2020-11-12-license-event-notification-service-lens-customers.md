The License Event Notification Service (LENS) is a tool that enables LENS customers to monitor a set of drivers’ qualifications, and to receive notifications of changes to drivers’ qualifications. The source for LENS drivers’ information is the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles Driving Record. LENS customers include employers of drivers, insurers of drivers and entities that regulate drivers or their employers.
