The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP) oversees more than 250 state parks, historic sites, recreational trails, golf courses, boat launches and more,  encompassing nearly 350,000 acres, that are visited by 74 million people annually.  These facilities contribute to the economic vitality and quality of life of local communities and directly support New Yorkâ€™s tourism industry.  Parks also provide a place for families and children to be active and exercise, promoting healthy lifestyles.  The agency is responsible for the operation and stewardship of the state park system as well as advancing a statewide parks, historic preservation, and open space mission.  The New York State Office of Parks and Recreation operates campgrounds in 65 state parks across New York (outside the Adirondack and Catskill Forest Preserves) offering more than 9,000 campsites, cabins and cottages.
