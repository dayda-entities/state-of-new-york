How does your organization use this dataset? What other NYSERDA or energy-related datasets would you like to see on Open NY? Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.

The Transportation Fuels Inventory dataset contains weekly stock amounts of  Central Atlantic diesel as well as gasoline from the Central Atlantic region (PADD 1B), East Coast (PADD 1) and the total U.S.  The dataset also contains fuel ethanol stocks for the East Coast and U.S. crude oil stocks. Additionally, East Coast jet fuel stocks are included. The data is collected on a weekly basis and measured in terms of thousands of barrels beginning in April 2004.
