The Agricultural Districts Profile summary is a county listing that identifies the agricultural district number and names of towns within each district. Each district listing includes: creation date, anniversay date, total acres, farmed acres, cropped acres, acres owned, rented acres and number of farms.  This dataset will be updated in January of each year. The Agricultural District Profile Data Summary is  found at the following link:http://www.agriculture.ny.gov/AP/agservices/agdistricts.html. The Agricultural District Profile contains a listing of each county participating in the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (DAM) Agricultural District program. Agricultural districts have been created in 53 of New Yorkâ€™s 62 counties. Participation in the Agricultural District program is landowner initiated and represents a local mechanism for the protection and enhancement of farmlands as a viable segment of the local and state economies.
