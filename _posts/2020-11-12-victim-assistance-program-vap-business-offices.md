Since 1981, OVS has had a legislative appropriation for the purpose of making grants for the provision of local victim/witness assistance and services. Initially, twenty-three programs received grant funds for this purpose. Currently, 186 victim/witness assistance programs have grant awards from the OVS, ranging from $32,000 to over $1.8 million. OVS supports statewide, comprehensive victim/witness assistance services in all sectors of the community. Criminal justice agencies, non-profit victim programs and specific municipal programs all receive support. Examples include DA offices, Probation Departments, YWCAs, local police departments, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations. This data set contains all service locations associated with OVS VOCA awards. It should be noted that some programs do not have a physical address listed, instead, they show a PO Box. In these cases the physical addresses are safeguarded as they are generally Domestic Violence shelters providing services to victims who may be in danger were their location to be disclosed.
