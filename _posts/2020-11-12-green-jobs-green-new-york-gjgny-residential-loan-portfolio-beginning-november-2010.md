How does your organization use this dataset? What other NYSERDA or energy-related datasets would you like to see on Open NY? Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.

The dataset represents information on the performance of the portfolio of loans issued through the GJGNY Residential Loan Fund. The loan performance results of the GJGNY portfolio have shown strong performance to date, with lower levels of delinquencies and defaults/losses than other consumer loan asset classes. This performance data is useful to lender/capital providers, rating agencies, researchers, and interested stakeholders to assist in anticipating performance results for their-party financing products aimed at consumer clean energy financing. Users can access an Interactive Dashboard with charts, graphs, and tables at https://nyserda.ny.gov/Researchers-and-Policymakers/Green-Jobs-Green-New-York/Data-and-Trends
