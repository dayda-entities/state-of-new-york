The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey quarterly produces a data file and provides information on Shared Ride (airport transportation services by authorized vehicles) reservations. Shared Ride service is defined as multiple stop “door to door” services by authorized providers.  Although both reservation and passenger number for Shared Ride are simultaneously registered at the Port Authority’s Welcome Center when an individual makes a reservation, the Port Authority’s Ground Transportation Information System (GTIS) counts reservation numbers and passenger numbers separately as one reservation can have multiple passengers. This Shared Ride Reservation dataset reflects only the Shared Ride reservations.
