This data includes the number of Loan Forgiveness recipients by program type and the region, as designated by the Department of Labor, in which they are employed beginning award year 2011 (for HESC-administered Loan Forgiveness programs only).  Data has been collated by recipient region of employment.  For this purpose, the current New York State Department of Labor definitions of New York State Regions, as listed on their public web site, were used.
