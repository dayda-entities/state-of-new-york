How does your organization use this dataset? What other NYSERDA or energy-related datasets would you like to see on Open NY? Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a multi-state cap-and-trade mechanism where polluters of greenhouse gas emissions must either reduce emissions or purchase emissions allowances. New York State allocates funds received from selling allowances to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to manage programs aimed at reducing fossil fuel consumption. The New York State RGGI Auction Proceeds dataset provides the results from each allowance auction including the allowance clearing price, the total number of allowances sold by the State, and the value earned by the State from selling allowances.
