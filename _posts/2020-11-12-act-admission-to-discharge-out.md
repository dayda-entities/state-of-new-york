This dataset contains the number of discharged ACT participants at admission to ACT and at discharge from ACT within a set of outcome indicators such as living situation, employment and risk behaviors.   The data are aggregated by New York State region, year of discharge (past 5 years), AOT status at admission, and by behavioral health diagnosis at admission.
