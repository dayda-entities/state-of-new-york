How does your organization use this dataset? What other NYSERDA or energy-related datasets would you like to see on Open NY? Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.

The Multifamily Performance Program (MPP) serves residential buildings with five or more units. Funds are targeted at energy efficiency measures that help to reduce on-site electricity, oil, natural gas, steam, and propane energy demand and energy consumption in multi-unit residential buildings. All buildings receive program support for energy assessments to determine cost-effective measures, expected energy savings, and installation costs. The dataset includes information collected throughout the project application process and energy assessments from several NYSERDA-funded programs, including Multifamily Performance Program-Existing Buildings, Multifamily Performance Program-New Construction, and Multifamily Performance Program-Energy Star Pilot.

Information about the Projectsâ€™ location, utility, market type, number of buildings and units, and funding amount can be found in the Multifamily Residential Existing and New Construction Energy Efficiency Projects Reported by NYSERDA: Beginning 2005 dataset. 

Reported measure savings account for interactive effects between measures.
