New York State’s Charge NY initiative offers electric car buyers the Drive Clean Rebate of up to $2,000 for new car purchases or leases. The rebate amount depends on the battery-only range of each vehicle. Dealers enrolled in the program deduct the eligible amount from the vehicle price at the point of sale and then submit a rebate application with NYSERDA. This dataset includes all completed rebate applications as of the data through date.
