The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey quarterly produces a data file and provides information on Shared Ride reservations. Shared Ride activity is defined as multiple stop “door to door” services  by authorized providers.    Although both reservation and passenger number for Shared Ride are simultaneously registered at the Port Authority’s Welcome Center when an individual makes a reservation, the Port Authority’s Ground Transportation Information System (GTIS) counts reservation numbers and passenger numbers separately as one reservation can have multiple passengers. This Shared Ride Reservation dataset reflects only the Shared Ride passengers.
