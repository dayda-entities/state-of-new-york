The Waterbody Inventory/Priority Waterbodies List (WI/PWL) dataset is an inventory of the state's surface water quality. This dataset provides a summary of general water quality conditions, tracks the degree to which a waterbody supports its designated uses, and monitors progress toward the identification and resolution of water quality problems, pollutants, and sources.
