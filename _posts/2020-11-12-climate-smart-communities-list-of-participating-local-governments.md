The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) tracks the participation of local governments in the stateâ€™s Climate Smart Communities (CSC) Program. The dataset lists the CSC status of participating communities (Registered or Certified) and the date associated with that status, as well as the location of the community by county and region. DEC is one of six state agencies that sponsor the CSC Program. For a more up-to-date list of participating communities, please visit https://climatesmart.ny.gov/
