Industrial Development Agencies are required by section 859 of the General Municipal Law to submit annual financial statements, and are required by Section 2800 of Public Authorities Law to submit annual reports to the ABO. These statements include data concerning assistance provided and jobs created/retained for each project that receives financial assistance from the IDA. The dataset includes project data as reported by each IDA beginning with fiscal years ending in 2009.
