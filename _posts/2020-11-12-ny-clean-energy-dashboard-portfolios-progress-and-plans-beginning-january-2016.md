How does your organization use this dataset? What other NYSERDA or energy-related datasets would you like to see on Open NY? Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.

This dataset contains Portfolio-level budget data from the New York State Clean Energy Dashboard (https://rev.ny.gov/cleanenergydashboard). The Clean Energy Dashboard aggregates budgets and benefits progress data across dozens of programs administered by NYSERDA and utilities. The Clean Energy Dashboard features most of the programs and initiatives that contribute significantly to New York State’s aggressive clean energy goals while tracking progress against both utilities’ and New York State’s targets.
