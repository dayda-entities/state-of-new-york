This dataset includes details for each wildland fire recorded after 2007 under the jurisdiction of the DEC NYS Forest Rangers. Earlier wildfires (1975-2007) under the jurisdiction of NYS DEC Forest Rangers can be found in the historical wildfire dataset. That dataset was formatted for use with FireFamily Plus. Each wildfire controlled or prescribed fire conducted by NYS DEC Forest Rangers is documented as a single incident in this database.
