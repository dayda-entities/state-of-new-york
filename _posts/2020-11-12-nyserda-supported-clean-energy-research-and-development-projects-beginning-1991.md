How does your organization use this dataset? What other NYSERDA or energy-related datasets would you like to see on Open NY? Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and support to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and accelerate economic growth. To learn more about NYSERDA’s programs, visit nyserda.ny.gov or follow us on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. The NYSERDA Supported Clean Energy Research and Development Projects dataset names clean energy companies receiving non-equity pre-seed funding (grants) from NYSERDA’s Technology and Business Innovation programs. These programs are designed not only to develop better clean energy technologies but also to provide multiple ways to create products and services that benefit NYS energy users. Dataset is current as of the end of the last calendar quarter (March, June, September, or December). Each record contains the Application ID, Primary Contractor Name, Contractor Type, Project Type, Technology, Project Title, Contractor location, Contractor Website, Award Date, and Award Amount. For more information on a specific project in this dataset, please visit https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Researchers-and-Policymakers/Research-Project/.
