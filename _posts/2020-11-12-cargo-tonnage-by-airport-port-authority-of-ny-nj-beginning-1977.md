The dataset presented in this forum is monthly data. The Port Authority collects monthly data for domestic and international cargo, flight, passengers and aircraft equipment type from each carrier at PANYNJ-operated airports. The data is aggregated and forms the basis for estimating flight fees, parking, concession, and PFC revenues at the Port Authority Airports.
