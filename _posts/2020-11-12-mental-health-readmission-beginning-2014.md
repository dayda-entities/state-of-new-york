New York State is moving Medicaid behavioral health services from a fee-for-service system into Managed Care.
OMH Medicaid Behavioral Health Measures were developed to help monitor the transition of mental health and substance use disorder services from a fee-for-service to behavioral managed care. 

The MH Readmission dataset displays percentages of Medicaid discharges for members 6-64 years of age who were hospitalized in an inpatient setting with a primary diagnosis of mental illness that were followed by an unplanned Mental Health readmission within 30 and 90 days of discharge.
