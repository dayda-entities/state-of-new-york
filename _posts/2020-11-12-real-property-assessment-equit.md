The Department of Taxation and Finance annually produces a report documenting the results of the Market Value Survey pertaining to property assessment.  The report contains the staff findings regarding assessment equity by municipality in New York State, that is, the degree to which assessments are at a uniform percentage of their market value.  Equity is measured primarily by two statistics â€” the coefficient of dispersion (COD) and the price-related differential (PRD).
