Dataset contains monthly counts, from July 2003 to present, of initial claims for regular unemployment insurance benefits. 

Initial Claims include new claims as well as subsequent additional claims filed. New claims are filed in person, by mail, telephone or other means to request a determination of entitlement to and eligibility for compensation which results in an agency generated document of an appealable monetary determination provided to the potential claimant. Additional claims are filed during an existing benefit year due to new unemployment when a break of one week or more has occurred in the claim series due to intervening employment. 

Data are provided for New York State regions.  Region counts include only state residents who file a claim (excluding out-of-state residents).
