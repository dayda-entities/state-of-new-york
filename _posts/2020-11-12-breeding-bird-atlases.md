New York State’s first and second breeding bird atlases documented the distribution of the state’s avifauna during two distinct time periods: 1980-1985 and 2000-2005. Over 4,300 individuals submitted data during the first atlas yielding a final, cumulative dataset of over 361,583 records. Over 1,200 individuals submitted data for the second atlas project, resulting in a final database of 519,570 records.
