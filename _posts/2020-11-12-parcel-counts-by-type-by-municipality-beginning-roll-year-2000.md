The Department of Taxation and Finance annually produces a report pertaining to the distribution of parcels by property class.  The data analysis involves a breakdown of property classes to nine segments of broad use, namely Agricultural, Residential, Vacant Land/Farm, Commercial, Recreation, Community Service, Industrial, Public Service, and Forest/Conservation.
