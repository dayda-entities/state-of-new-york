The SPDES Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP), which is administered by the Department of Environmental Conservation (the Department), regulates stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity from a point source.  The MSGP covers thirty one different industrial sectors which include activities such as mining, land transportation, and scrap recycling.  The dataset displays information on facilities that have active MSGP coverage in New York State.   Information included in the data set include the facility’s name, address, contact information, industrial sector(s), discharging waterbody, and location of the facility’s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan.
