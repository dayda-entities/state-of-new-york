Based on interconnection data, this dataset represents the most comprehensive source of installed solar projects, including projects that did not receive State funding, for all of New York State since 2000.

Since Governor Andrew M. Cuomo launched NY-Sun, a total of 1 GW of solar photovoltaic has been installed or is under contract for installation, which represents more solar photovoltaic than was installed in the entire prior decade. In his 2013 State of the State address, Governor Cuomo announced that the initiative would extend to 2023. Nearly $1 billion in funding has been authorized over 10 years to meet a statewide target of three gigawatts of installed capacity.
