This dataset contains records of spills of petroleum and other hazardous materials. Under State law and regulations, spills that could pollute the lands or waters of the state must be reported by the spiller (and, in some cases, by anyone who has knowledge of the spill). Examples of what may be included in a spill record includes: Administrative information (DEC region and unique seven-digit spill number). Program facility name. Spill date/time. Location. Spill source and cause. Material(s) and material type spilled. Quantity spilled and recovered. Units measured. Surface water bodies affected. Close date (cleanup activity finished and all paperwork completed).
