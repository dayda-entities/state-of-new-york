These statistics come from more than three million data items reported on about 250,000 sales tax returns filed quarterly and on about 300,000 returns filed annually.  The dataset categorizes quarterly sales and purchases data by industry group using the North American Industry Classification System.   The status of data will change as preliminary data becomes final.
