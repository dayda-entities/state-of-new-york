The Holocaust Claims Processing Office (“HCPO”) was established in 1997 to provide institutional assistance to individuals seeking to recover assets lost due to Nazi persecution. Claimants pay no fee for the HCPO’s services, nor does the HCPO take a percentage of the value of the assets recovered.   The mission of the HCPO is threefold: (1) recover assets deposited in banks; (2) recover proceeds of unpaid insurance policies; and, (3) recover art lost, looted, or sold under duress between 1933 and 1945.
