The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation requires shipments of hazardous waste from small and large quantity generators be tracked using a hazardous waste manifest. This tracking document must contain the names and addresses of the generator of the waste, transporter of the waste, and the destination facility of the waste. The manifest is also used to track the types and quantities of wastes being shipped as well as shipments that are rejected or re-directed.
