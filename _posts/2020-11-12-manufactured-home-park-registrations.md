This dataset captures the park name, address, and county in which a maufactured home park is located; the number of site capacity and number of occupied sites; and the name and contact number for the park owner/operator. New York State Homes and Community Renewalâ€™s (HCR) Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) oversees the registration of these parks in accordance with NYS Real Property Law Section 233 sub-section (v.) which requires owners of manufactured home parks with three or more homes register their park with DHCR.
