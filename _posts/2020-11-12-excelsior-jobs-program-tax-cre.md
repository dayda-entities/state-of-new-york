Chapter 59 of the Laws of 2010 requires the Tax Department to produce an Excelsior Jobs Program Credit Report by June 30th of each year.  The program is administered by Empire State Development and offers a tax credit comprised of four credit components focused on certain strategic industries such as biotechnology, pharmaceutical, high-tech, clean-technology, green technology, financial services, agriculture, manufacturing and life sciences.  The components of the credit are the jobs tax credit, the investment tax credit, the research and development tax credit, and the real property tax credit.  Firms in the strategic industries that create and maintain new jobs or make significant investments are eligible to apply for the credit.
