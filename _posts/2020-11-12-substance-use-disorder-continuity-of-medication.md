New York State is moving Medicaid behavioral health services from a fee-for-service system into Managed Care.
OMH/OASAS Medicaid Behavioral Health Measures were developed to help monitor the transition of mental health and substance use disorder services from a fee-for-service to behavioral managed care. 

The SUD Continuity of Medication dataset displays percentages of Medicaid discharges for members 6-64 years of age who were hospitalized in a SUD inpatient detoxification or SUD inpatient rehabilitation setting that were filled prescription for anti-addiction medication within a period of discharge.
