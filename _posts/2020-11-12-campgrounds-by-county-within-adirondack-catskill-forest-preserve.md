The Department of Environmental Conservation operates 51 campgrounds located in the Adirondack and Catskill Parks. The campgrounds provide a wide variety of experiences, including island camping, tent and trailer camping, boat launching facilities, hiking trails, beaches and day use areas with picnic tables and grills. Fishing licenses are no longer being sold at any of our campground facilities.
