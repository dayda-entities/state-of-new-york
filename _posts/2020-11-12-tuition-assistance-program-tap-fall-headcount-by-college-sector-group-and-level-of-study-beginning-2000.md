The Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), New York's largest student financial aid grant program, helps eligible New York residents attending in-state post-secondary institutions pay for tuition.  TAP grants are based on the applicant’s and his or her family’s New York State taxable income.  This data includes the number of recipients as measured by students receiving a TAP award for the fall semester beginning academic year 2000.
