Since January 2012, the Division of Buildings & Regulatory Compliance has created a living database documenting vacant buildings in the City of Albany. To create this database, the Division reconciled the Division of Building and Codes Vacant Building Registry with the Department of Fire and Emergency Services Vacant Building Database. This first reconciliation yielded a list of approximately 750 vacant buildings. The Division then reconciled that list with lists from neighborhood associations and lists from the Department of Assessment and Taxation.
