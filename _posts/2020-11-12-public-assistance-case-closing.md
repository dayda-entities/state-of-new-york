This dataset, from New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, provides the number of Public Assistance case closings in each month by reason for case closing, for each Local Social Services District (SSD).  It is similar to data published on an annual basis in the "Statistical Report on the Operations of New York State Public Assistance Programs."
