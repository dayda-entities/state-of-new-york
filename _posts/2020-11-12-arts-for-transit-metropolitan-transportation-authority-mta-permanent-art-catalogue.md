Through the Permanent Art Program, Arts for Transit commissions public art that is seen by millions of city-dwellers as well as national and international visitors who use the MTAâ€™s subways and trains. Arts for Transit works closely with the architects and engineers at MTA NYC Transit, Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad, to determine the parameters and sites for the artwork that is to be incorporated into each station scheduled for renovation. Both well-established and emerging artists contribute to the growing collection of works created in the materials of the system -mosaic, ceramic, tile, bronze, steel and glass. Artists are chosen through a competitive process that uses selection panels comprised of visual arts professionals and community representatives which review and select artists. This data provides the branch or station and the artist and artwork information.
