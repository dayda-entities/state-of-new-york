Estimated gasoline sales data is derived from New York StateDepartment of Taxation and Finance data on gasoline sales andgasoline sales tax collections. Gasoline sales data is estimated for eachcounty with the exception that individual county data for New YorkCity is not available. Data is weighted for regional price differencesand differing county tax rates.
