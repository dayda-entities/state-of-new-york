The New York State metropolitan regions in the dataset are Albany (Albany-Schenectady-Troy), Batavia, Binghamton, Buffalo (Buffalo-Niagara Falls), Dutchess (Dutchess-Putnam), Elmira, Glens Falls, Ithaca, Kingston, Nassau (Nassau-Suffolk), New York City, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica (Utica-Rome), Watertown (Watertown-Fort Drum), and White Plains.
