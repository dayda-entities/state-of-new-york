These reports provide summary information about mental health service utilization funded through Medicaid for Local Fiscal Years, beginning in service year 2006 and updated yearly thereafter. Totals are based on date of service and data are refreshed on a monthly basis so values in the same report may change over time. Prepaid Mental Health Plan (PMHP) data are included in these reports as Recovery Services (RS); however, Medicaid Managed Care data are not included. Expenditures include Comprehensive Outpatient Program Services (COPS) and Community Support Program (CSP) add-on payments, where applicable.
