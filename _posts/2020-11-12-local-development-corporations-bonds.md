Public authorities are required by Section 2800 of Public Authorities Law to submit annual reports to the Authorities Budget Office that include bonds data. Local development corporations are required to report information on the projects they support and how those approved projects are financed (either through grants, loans, or bonds). The dataset consists bonds data reported by Local Development Corporations beginning with fiscal years ending in 2011.
