The Division of Building Standards and Codes (BSC) administers the mandatory statewide Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code (Uniform Code) and State Energy Conservation Construction Code (Energy Code). The Division provides technical assistance, administers variances, delivers educational courses, oversees the enforcement practices of local governments and serves as secretariat to the State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council. The Division program was created by Chapter 707 of the Laws of 1981. The New York Legislature enacted Article 18 of the Executive Law, directing the formulation of a Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code (Uniform Code). The Uniform Code is designed to cover new construction, building rehabilitation, fire safety, and housing maintenance.

This dataset provides annually reported data on administration and enforcement of the State Energy Conservation Construction Code in each local government jurisdiction pursuant to 19 NYCRR 1203.
