The Workers’ Compensation Board (WCB) administers and regulates workers’ compensation benefits, disability benefits, volunteer firefighters’ benefits, volunteer ambulance workers’ benefits, and volunteer civil defense workers’ benefits. The WCB processes and adjudicates claims for benefits; ensures employer compliance with the requirement to maintain appropriate insurance coverage; and regulates the various system stakeholders, including self-insured employers, medical providers, third party administrators, insurance carriers and legal representatives.  Claim assembly occurs when the WCB learns of a workplace injury and assigns the claim a WCB claim number. The WCB “assembles” a claim in which an injured worker has lost more than one week of work, has a serious injury that may result in a permanent disability, is disputed by the carrier or employer, or receives a claim form from the injured worker (Form C-3).  A reopened claim is one that has been reactivated to resolve new issues following a finding that no further action was necessary
