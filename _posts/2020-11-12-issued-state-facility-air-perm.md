Owners or operators of emission sources that are subject to 6 NYCRR Subpart 201-5 must obtain a State facility permit.  

Draft permits are official versions of permits whose initial development is complete, public notice given, and made available for public review and comment.
  
These permits are prepared by the Division of Air Resources regional staff.
