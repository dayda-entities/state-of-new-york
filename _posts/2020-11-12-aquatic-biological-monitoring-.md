The Division of Water Stream Biomonitoring Unit (SBU) dataset contains the point sampling locations at which benthic macroinvertebrates, field chemistry, and at some locations, sediment, fish or diatoms have been collected as part of the Rotating Integrated Basin Studies (RIBS) program, Rapid Biological Assessments (RAS), or special studies. The data collected are used for water quality assessment (input to the Waterbody Inventory, completion of the 305(b) report and 303(d) list of impaired Waters) and for track-down of water quality problems. The data set is maintained by the Division of Water, Bureau of Water Assessment and Management, Stream Biomonitoring Unit.
