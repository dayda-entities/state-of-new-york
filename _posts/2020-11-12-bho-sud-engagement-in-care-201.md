The Behavioral Health Organization (BHO) initiative oversees the transition to managed care for Medicaid recipients who receive mental health (MH) and substance use disorder (SUD) services in New York State. The metrics emphasize improving rates of timely follow-up treatment post discharge, timely filling of appropriate medication prescriptions post discharge, and reducing rates of readmission.The BHO SUD Engagement in Care dataset is designed to assess the frequency with which individuals discharged from inpatient detoxification or chemical dependence inpatient rehabilitation engage in lower level substance use disorder treatment services within 14 and 30 days of discharge. Engagement is defined as receiving two or more such services within 14 days of discharge and three or more lower level services within 30 days of discharge.
The year 2015 saw the conclusion of the first phase of the Behavioral Health Organization initiative
(BHO). A new Behavioral Health Managed Care Transition phase II is underway. The data contained in
the BHO metrics span 2010 to 2014, using the 2010 calendar year for a baseline. Earlier in the program
(2011‐2012) the metrics were calculated quarterly and on a year‐to‐date basis, later in (2013‐2014),
New York State Office of Mental Health opted for semi‐annual and year‐to‐date aggregations.
