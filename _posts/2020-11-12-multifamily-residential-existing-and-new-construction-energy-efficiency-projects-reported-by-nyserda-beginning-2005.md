How does your organization use this dataset? What other NYSERDA or energy-related datasets would you like to see on Open NY? Let us know by emailing OpenNY@nyserda.ny.gov.

The Multifamily Performance Program (MPP) serves residential buildings with five or more units. Funds are targeted at energy efficiency measures that help to reduce on-site electricity, oil,  natural gas, steam, and propane energy demand and energy consumption in multi-unit residential buildings. All buildings receive program support for energy assessments to identify and determine cost-effective measures, expected energy savings, and installation costs. Our dataset is then compiled from the information. The dataset includes information collected throughout the project application process and energy assessments from several NYSERDA-funded programs, including Multifamily Performance Program-Existing Buildings, Multifamily Performance Program-New Construction, and Multifamily Performance Program-Energy Star Pilot.
The Multifamily Residential Existing and New Construction Energy Efficiency Projects Reported by NYSERDA: Beginning 2005 dataset includes the following data points for completed projects: Project Name, Program Type, Building Address1, Building City, Building ZIP, Property County, Electric Utility, Gas Utility, Market Type, Number of Buildings, Number of Units, Application NYSERDA Approved Date, Project Completed Date, Funding Amount, Proposed Install Unit Cost, Total Estimated Electric Savings, Total Estimated Annual Energy Savings, and Total Estimated Electric Demand Reduction (MW). Information about the Projectsâ€™ measures, measure category, and estimated energy savings by fuel type can be found in the Multifamily Residential Existing and New Construction Energy Efficiency Measures Reported by NYSERDA: Beginning 2005 dataset.
Reported savings account for interactive effects between measures.
